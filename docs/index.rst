*SimulAi is a library that, through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, allows optimization of variables derived from the Simulation of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS).*

*Given that decision-making in organizations is a complex task, due to the unpredictable dynamic nature and the large number of variables that intervene in the normal functioning of an organization, Simulai is presented with the objective, through the use of digital twins , improve the decision-making process in organizations, making it more efficient and secure.*

*Initially the work will focus on the integration of Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software with diverse methods of optimization, which will be submitted to a process of improvement throughout the Doctorate stage in development.*

*In the future, it is expected to achieve a library of greater accessibility, allowing the application in various simulation software, as required by the user.*

OS Windows, Tecnomatix Plant Simulation version 15.0 and pywin32 library are currently required for its operation.
